## ⚡ Overview

**re-flow** (**Flow / تک‌نقطه**) is an open-source, 100% offline daily focus app built with Flutter. Built around a dark "Liquid Glass" theme and behavioral psychology principles, it eliminates streak anxiety, remote tracking, and clutter — centering your daily energy around one primary goal (**The Boulder / تخته‌سنگ**).

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is an enhanced, internationalized fork of [Mahdi-mortazavi/flow](https://github.com/Mahdi-mortazavi/flow) with full English/Persian LTR/RTL support, customizable accent palettes, dynamic OS launcher labels, exact scheduled task alarms, active-days task scaling, and automated CI/CD releases.
